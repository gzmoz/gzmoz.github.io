        <h2>MemorEase</h2>
        <p>
            MemorEase is a mobile application designed to help people with memory problems, especially elderly individuals and Alzheimerâ€™s patients. The goal of the project is to improve memory recall by using personalized quizzes and reminders based on photos, audio, and memories uploaded by their relatives. These quizzes are created with the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology, which analyzes the uploaded content to generate questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application also provides a reporting system that analyzes the patient's answers. These reports can help identify which parts of the brain might be more affected by memory loss. This information can serve as a reference for doctors, reducing the burden on the healthcare system and improving the care for patients.
